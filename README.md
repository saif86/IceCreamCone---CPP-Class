# IceCreamCone---CPP-Class
Defining class in C++

## Problem Statement
Create a class named **IceCreamCone** with fields for *flavor*, *number of scoops*, *type of cone*, and *price*. Unless arguments are supplied, *flavor* defaults to **"Vanilla"**, *number of scoops* defaults to **1**, and *cone type* defaults to **"Sugar"**. The constructor calculates the *price* based on 75 cents per scoop, with an additional 40 cents for a waffle cone. Write a main( ) function demonstrating that the class works correctly. Save the file as *IceCreamCone.cpp*.
